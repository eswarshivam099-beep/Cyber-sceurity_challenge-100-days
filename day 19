Day 19: SQL Injection (SQLi) – The "King" of Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection is a "logic" flaw where an application incorrectly handles data provided by a user. When the application takes that data and stitches it directly into a database query, it gives the user the power to "talk" to the database.

    The Three Main Types:

        In-Band (Classic): The attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results.

            Example: A UNION-based attack where the attacker joins their own query to the original one to display all usernames and passwords on the screen.

        Inferential (Blind): The application doesn't display data directly. The attacker asks "True/False" questions.

            Boolean-based: "If the first letter of the admin password is 'A', load the page normally." If the page loads, the attacker knows the letter.

            Time-based: "If the database version is 5.0, wait 10 seconds before responding." If the site lags, the information is confirmed.

        Out-of-Band: The attacker makes the database send data to an external server they control (e.g., via DNS or HTTP requests).

    The Fix: Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries). This treats user input strictly as "data" and never as "executable code," making injection impossible.

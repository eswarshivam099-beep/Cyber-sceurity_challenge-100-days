1. What are submarine cables?

Submarine cables are high-capacity fiber-optic cables laid on the seabed that connect continents and countries.
They are the physical backbone of the global internet.

Over 95% of international internet traffic (emails, video calls, cloud access, banking transactions) flows through these cables.

Satellites are used mainly for remote areas or backup, not for bulk internet traffic.

Each cable contains:

Fiber-optic strands that transmit data as light pulses

Repeaters/amplifiers placed every 50–100 km to boost signals

Protective layers to survive deep-sea pressure

2. How internet traffic travels under oceans

When you:

Send a WhatsApp message

Open a website hosted in another country

Make a Zoom call

The data:

Travels from your device to a local ISP

Moves through national fiber networks

Enters a submarine cable landing station

Crosses the ocean floor via submarine cables

Reaches another country’s landing station

Continues through terrestrial networks to the destination server

So even “wireless” activities ultimately rely on physical cables.

3. Key realization: The internet is not purely digital

Many people assume cyber space is:

Virtual

Cloud-based

Invisible

But submarine cables show that:

The internet is deeply physical

Digital communication depends on real-world infrastructure

Servers, data centers, landing stations, and cables are all physical assets

This changes how we understand cybersecurity.

4. Cyber attacks are not only software-based

Traditionally, cyber attacks are associated with:

Malware

Phishing

DDoS attacks

Hacking servers

But submarine cables reveal a physical attack surface:

Physical threats include:

Cutting or damaging undersea cables

Sabotaging landing stations

Interfering with cable repair operations

Espionage via cable tapping

A single damaged cable can:

Slow or disconnect entire regions

Disrupt banking systems

Affect stock markets

Interrupt emergency communications

5. Real-world implications
a) National security

Countries treat submarine cables as strategic assets because:

Military communications depend on them

Intelligence data flows through them

Economic systems rely on them

b) Economic impact

Damage can lead to:

Internet outages

Trade disruption

Financial losses in millions per hour

c) Cybersecurity strategy shift

Security must include:

Physical protection of cable routes

Surveillance of landing stations

International cooperation

Redundancy and backup routes

6. Why this insight is important

This understanding helps you realize that:

Cybersecurity is not just about code

Digital systems are only as strong as their physical foundations

Attacks can be hybrid (physical + digital)

Protecting infrastructure is as important as protecting data

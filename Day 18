1️⃣ What Is Burp Suite?

Burp Suite is an intercepting proxy used by:

Ethical hackers

Penetration testers

Security teams

Malicious attackers

It sits between the browser and the server, allowing full visibility and control over HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

2️⃣ How Request Interception Works
Normal Flow (No Proxy)
Browser → Server → Response

With Burp Suite
Browser → Burp Suite → Server → Burp Suite → Browser


This allows attackers to:

See every request

Pause requests

Modify parameters

Replay or resend them

3️⃣ Intercepting HTTP Requests
What You Learned

Using Burp’s Intercept feature, attackers can:

Capture login requests

View headers, cookies, tokens

Inspect request bodies (JSON, form data)

Example
POST /login
username=user1
password=Welcome@123


Even if the UI hides fields, Burp reveals everything sent to the server.

4️⃣ Modifying Requests (Tampering)

Attackers can change request data before it reaches the server.

Common Modifications

Change user roles (role=user → role=admin)

Modify prices (price=100 → price=1)

Change user IDs (userId=101 → userId=102)

Remove client-side validations

Key Learning

Client-side controls can never be trusted.
Only server-side validation matters.

5️⃣ Replaying Requests (Replay Attacks)

Using tools like Repeater or Intruder, attackers can:

Resend requests multiple times

Automate attacks

Test different payloads

Example Scenarios

Replaying a payment request → double charge

Reusing password reset tokens

Testing IDOR vulnerabilities

6️⃣ Why This Is Extremely Dangerous

Because:

Applications often trust incoming requests

Developers assume users follow UI rules

APIs expose more data than the frontend shows

This leads to:

Broken Access Control

Injection attacks

Business logic abuse

Account takeover

7️⃣ OWASP Top 10 Mapping (Very Important)

Day 18 directly maps to:

Broken Access Control

Injection

Identification & Authentication Failures

Insecure Design

Security Misconfiguration

Burp Suite is often the primary tool used to exploit OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

8️⃣ Key Security Lessons from Day 18
🔒 Never Trust the Client

UI validation ≠ Security

JavaScript checks can be bypassed

🛡️ Enforce Server-Side Controls

Authorization checks on every request

Validate tokens, roles, ownership

🔍 Secure APIs

Validate input strictly

Implement rate limiting

Protect against replay attacks

🧪 Test Like an Attacker

Intercept requests

Modify parameters

Attempt unauthorized actions

9️⃣ Learning Outcome (Day 18 Takeaway)

If an attacker can intercept and modify requests, they can control your application unless strong server-side security exists.

You clearly learned:

How attackers think

How HTTP manipulation works

Why API security is critical

Why frontend security alone is useless

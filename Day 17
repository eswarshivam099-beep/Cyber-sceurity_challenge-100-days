1️⃣ What Is a Brute-Force Attack?

A brute-force attack is an automated attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying:

Large numbers of passwords

Common password lists (dictionary attacks)

Username–password combinations leaked from previous breaches

Attackers use tools and scripts to make thousands of login attempts per minute.

2️⃣ Why Weak Passwords Are Dangerous
Characteristics of Weak Passwords

Short length (e.g., 123456, admin123)

Common words or patterns

Reused across multiple websites

No complexity (no symbols, uppercase, numbers)

Real-World Reality

Most users:

Reuse passwords

Choose predictable patterns

Ignore password hygiene

This makes brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks highly effective.

3️⃣ Role of Missing Rate Limiting
What Is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting restricts:

Number of login attempts per IP

Number of attempts per account

Speed of requests over time

What Happens Without It?

Unlimited login attempts

Attack scripts can try millions of combinations

No alerts or blocking

Example Scenario
Login attempts allowed: Unlimited
Result: Password cracked in minutes


Without rate limiting, the system unintentionally helps the attacker.

4️⃣ What You Observed During Simulation

During your simulation, you likely noticed:

✔ Login attempts were not blocked
✔ No CAPTCHA after multiple failures
✔ No account lockout
✔ No alerting or logging
✔ Eventually, correct credentials succeeded

This demonstrates how defensive controls matter more than just encryption.

5️⃣ Real-World Impact of Brute-Force Attacks
Consequences

Account takeover (email, banking, CRM)

Data theft (PII, financial data)

Privilege escalation

Reputation damage

Compliance violations

Famous Attack Types

Brute-force

Dictionary attack

Credential stuffing

Most breaches today start with stolen or guessed credentials.

6️⃣ Why This Is a Critical OWASP Risk

This topic directly maps to:

Identification and Authentication Failures

Broken Access Control

It remains one of the top causes of real-world breaches because:

It’s easy to automate

Users choose weak passwords

Applications forget rate-limiting

7️⃣ Key Security Controls You Learned Are Necessary
🔒 Strong Password Policies

Minimum length (12+ characters)

Complexity rules

Block common passwords

⏱️ Rate Limiting

Limit attempts per IP

Limit attempts per account

Progressive delays

🔐 Account Lockout

Temporary lock after failures

Admin/user notification

🧠 CAPTCHA

Trigger after suspicious behavior

🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Stops brute-force even if password is cracked

8️⃣ Learning Outcome (Day 17 Takeaway)

Passwords alone are not enough.
Security depends on controls around authentication, not just credentials.

By simulating brute-force attacks, you clearly understood:

How attackers think

Why weak passwords fail

Why rate limiting is mandatory, not optional

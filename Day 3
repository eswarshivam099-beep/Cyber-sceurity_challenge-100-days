1. What is WHOIS and Why It Matters in OSINT

WHOIS is a publicly accessible protocol and database used to retrieve registration information about domain names and IP addresses.

Why WHOIS is important:
	•	It answers the question: “Who owns or controls this domain?”
	•	It provides foundational intelligence before deeper technical analysis
	•	It helps differentiate between:
	•	Legitimate businesses
	•	Newly created scam or phishing websites

In OSINT, WHOIS is often the first step because:
	•	It requires no interaction with the target
	•	It is legal, passive, and non-intrusive
	•	It provides metadata that guides further investigation

2. Domain Registrar – What It Tells You

What is a Domain Registrar?

A domain registrar is an organization authorized to sell and manage domain names (e.g., .com, .org, .net).

Why registrars matter in investigations:
	•	Scam websites often use cheap or lenient registrars
	•	Some registrars have a history of abuse complaints
	•	Repeated use of the same registrar can indicate organized scam operations

OSINT value:
	•	Helps identify patterns across multiple fraudulent domains
	•	Useful for reporting abuse to the registrar
	•	Can be correlated with known scam campaigns

3. Hosting Provider & Name Servers – Infrastructure Intelligence

Hosting Provider

The hosting provider is the company that stores the website’s files and serves them to users.

Name Servers (DNS)

Name servers translate domain names into IP addresses.

Why this is critical:
	•	Many scam networks reuse the same hosting provider
	•	Shared name servers can link multiple malicious domains
	•	Bulletproof hosting providers are commonly used by scammers

OSINT insights:
	•	Infrastructure reuse suggests common ownership
	•	Helps uncover entire scam ecosystems
	•	Supports takedown or threat-intel reporting

4. Domain Creation & Expiry Dates – Timeline Analysis

Creation Date

Shows when the domain was first registered.

Red flags:
	•	Domain registered days or weeks ago
	•	Website claims years of experience but domain is new

Expiry Date

Shows how long the domain is registered for.

Scam indicators:
	•	1-year registrations (cheap and disposable)
	•	Short-lived domains used for fast fraud

OSINT importance:
	•	Establishes timeline inconsistencies
	•	Strengthens fraud attribution
	•	Helps determine campaign lifespan

5. Registrant Contact Details – Attribution Clues

What registrant data may include:
	•	Name
	•	Organization
	•	Email address
	•	Country
	•	Phone number

Privacy Protection

Most scammers use WHOIS privacy services to hide identity.

Why this still matters:
	•	Privacy usage itself is a risk indicator
	•	Sometimes partial data leaks through
	•	Older WHOIS records may expose real details

OSINT application:
	•	Compare contact emails across domains
	•	Identify reused fake names or organizations
	•	Link domains to known threat actors

6. WHOIS as a Starting Point (Not the End)

WHOIS does not solve investigations alone, but it:
	•	Provides direction
	•	Narrows down next steps
	•	Saves time by eliminating guesswork

Typical next steps after WHOIS:
	•	DNS enumeration
	•	IP address analysis
	•	SSL certificate inspection
	•	Website fingerprinting
	•	Social media & email correlation

WHOIS answers “Where should I look next?”

7. Identifying Scam Networks Using WHOIS Correlation

By comparing WHOIS data across domains, investigators can:

Link websites using:
	•	Same registrar
	•	Same name servers
	•	Same hosting provider
	•	Similar registration dates
	•	Identical privacy services

Result:
	•	Discovery of multiple fake crypto sites
	•	Identification of coordinated scam campaigns
	•	Evidence of professional fraud operations

This is how individual scams are traced back to organized cybercrime groups.

8. Preserving WHOIS Data as Evidence

Why preservation is critical:
	•	Scam domains are often:
	•	Deleted
	•	Transferred
	•	Modified
	•	WHOIS data can change rapidly

Evidence preservation methods:
	•	Screenshots of WHOIS results
	•	Exporting WHOIS records
	•	Using historical WHOIS databases
	•	Recording timestamps

Legal & investigative value:
	•	Supports law enforcement complaints
	•	Used in cybersecurity incident reports
	•	Helps threat-intelligence sharing

⸻

9. WHOIS in Real-World Cybersecurity & SOC Work

Used by:
	•	SOC analysts
	•	Threat intelligence teams
	•	Fraud investigators
	•	Law enforcement
	•	Compliance teams

Practical use cases:
	•	Phishing investigations
	•	Crypto fraud detection
	•	Brand impersonation cases
	•	Malware hosting analysis

WHOIS is often part of initial triage in incident response.

10. Key Learning Outcome from Day 3

By the end of Day 3, the key understanding is:

WHOIS transforms suspicion into evidence.

You learned how to:
	•	Avoid assumptions
	•	Use structured investigation methods
	•	Identify patterns and infrastructure reuse
	•	Build defensible, evidence-based conclusions

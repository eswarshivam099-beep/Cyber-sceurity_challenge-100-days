 Broken Access Control
What it is

When users can access data or perform actions they are not authorized for.

Common Examples

A normal user accessing admin URLs

Changing user IDs in URLs (/user/123 → /user/124)

Missing role-based checks on APIs

Real-World Impact

Account takeover

Data exposure (PII, financial data)

Privilege escalation

Example
GET /api/orders?userId=1002


If the system does not verify ownership, attackers can change userId.

Prevention

Enforce server-side authorization

Use deny-by-default access rules

Validate permissions on every request

2️⃣ Cryptographic Failures (Previously Sensitive Data Exposure)
What it is

Failure to properly encrypt sensitive data at rest or in transit.

Common Examples

Storing passwords in plain text

Using weak encryption (MD5, SHA-1)

Missing HTTPS (TLS)

Real-World Impact

Credential theft

Financial fraud

Regulatory penalties (GDPR, HIPAA)

Prevention

Use strong encryption (AES-256, bcrypt)

Enforce HTTPS everywhere

Never store passwords in plain text

3️⃣ Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP)
What it is

When untrusted input is sent directly to an interpreter.

Common Examples

SQL Injection

SOQL Injection (Salesforce context)

Command Injection

Example
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --'

Real-World Impact

Full database compromise

Data deletion

Unauthorized access

Prevention

Use prepared statements

Validate & sanitize inputs

Avoid dynamic queries

4️⃣ Insecure Design
What it is

Flaws in application architecture or logic, not coding mistakes.

Common Examples

No rate-limiting for login attempts

Trusting client-side validations

No threat modeling

Why It’s Dangerous

Even perfectly written code can be insecure if design is weak.

Prevention

Threat modeling

Secure design patterns

Abuse-case analysis

5️⃣ Security Misconfiguration
What it is

Using insecure default configurations.

Common Examples

Default admin credentials

Open S3 buckets

Detailed error messages shown to users

Real-World Impact

Attackers gain easy entry

Infrastructure takeover

Prevention

Harden configurations

Disable unnecessary services

Regular security audits

6️⃣ Vulnerable and Outdated Components
What it is

Using libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

Examples

Old Log4j versions

Outdated Spring or Apache libraries

Real-World Impact

Remote code execution

Massive breaches (e.g., Log4Shell)

Prevention

Dependency scanning

Regular patching

Remove unused components

7️⃣ Identification and Authentication Failures
What it is

Weak login and identity management mechanisms.

Common Examples

No account lockout

Weak passwords

Session IDs in URLs

Real-World Impact

Credential stuffing attacks

Account takeover

Prevention

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Strong password policies

Secure session handling

8️⃣ Software and Data Integrity Failures
What it is

Trusting software updates or data without verification.

Examples

Unverified CI/CD pipelines

Unsigned software updates

Insecure deserialization

Real-World Impact

Supply chain attacks

Malware injection

Prevention

Code signing

Secure CI/CD pipelines

Integrity checks

9️⃣ Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
What it is

Failure to detect and respond to attacks.

Common Issues

No audit logs

Logs not monitored

Alerts not configured

Why It’s Critical

Breaches go undetected for months.

Prevention

Centralized logging

Real-time alerts

Incident response plans

🔟 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
What it is

Attackers trick servers into making malicious internal requests.

Example
https://example.com/fetch?url=http://localhost/admin

Real-World Impact

Access to internal services

Cloud metadata theft

Prevention

Validate URLs

Block internal IP access

Use allow-lists
